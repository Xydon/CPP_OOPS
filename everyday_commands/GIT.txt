uses 
example 


1. PULL
git pull <options><remote>/<branchname> 


use to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local repository. 
It combines the git fetch command (which retrieves changes from the remote repository) with the 
git merge command (which merges the changes into your local branch).


command is commonly used when working collaboratively on a project with other developers, 
as it allows you to keep your local repository up-to-date with changes made by others.

git pull origin main
This command pulls changes from the "main" branch of the remote repository 
called "origin" into the current local branch.




2. branch
git branch my-branch

create a new branch to store any new changes


3. git checkout my-branch
switch to that branch


4. 
Command: Clone a repository
Command syntax: git clone <repository URL>

This command creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

This is useful when we want to work on a project that is hosted on GitHub or 
another Git hosting service. By cloning the repository, we can make 
changes to the code and then push those changes back to the 
remote repository.



5. Committing Changes

Command Syntax: git commit -m "commit message"

This command creates a new commit with changes that have been staged previously. The -m option is used to include a commit message.

This command is used to record changes to the repository history.

example git commit -m "added new feature"
