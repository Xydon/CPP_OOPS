what the command does 
uses 
example 


1. PULL
git pull <options><remote>/<branchname> 


use to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local repository. 
It combines the git fetch command (which retrieves changes from the remote repository) with the 
git merge command (which merges the changes into your local branch).


command is commonly used when working collaboratively on a project with other developers, 
as it allows you to keep your local repository up-to-date with changes made by others.

git pull origin main
This command pulls changes from the "main" branch of the remote repository 
called "origin" into the current local branch.




2. Create a new branch
Command syntax: git branch [new_branch_name]
Creates a new branch with the given name.
This is useful when you want to work on a new feature or fix a bug without 
affecting the main branch.
Example: git branch new-feature


3.  Add changes to the staging area
Command syntax: git add [file_name]
Adds the changes in the specified file to the staging area, ready to be committed.
Uses: This is useful when you want to stage specific changes for commit, 
instead of committing all changes in your working directory.
Example: git add index.html


4. 
Command: Clone a repository
Command syntax: git clone <repository URL>

This command creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

This is useful when we want to work on a project that is hosted on GitHub or 
another Git hosting service. By cloning the repository, we can make 
changes to the code and then push those changes back to the 
remote repository.



5. Committing Changes

Command Syntax: git commit -m "commit message"

This command creates a new commit with changes that have been staged previously. The -m option is used to include a commit message.

This command is used to record changes to the repository history.

example git commit -m "added new feature"


6. Push changes to a remote repository
Command syntax: git push [remote_name] [branch_name]
Pushes the specified branch to the remote repository with the given name.
This is useful when we want to update our remote repository with your local changes.
Example: git push origin main


7. Merge branches

Command syntax: git merge [branch_name]
Merges the specified branch into the current branch.
Uses: This is useful when we want to incorporate changes from another branch into 
our current branch.
Example: git merge feature-branch
